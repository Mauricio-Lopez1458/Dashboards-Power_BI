RETAIL CLOTHING
Dataset extracted from Kaggle platform (kaggle.com).
Project still in progress.
It is a retail chain, both physical and online, that sells clothing and footwear. I performed analyses from several perspectives: sales, campaigns, and customers. I also plan to carry out an analysis of employees.
I used several measures with DAX expressions. For example, in the chart Sales Quantity – Selected Quarter vs. Previous Quarter, I applied the PREVIOUSQUARTER function in the DAX expression to calculate the number of sales from the quarter prior to the one being analyzed.
