Sales analysis of computer products.

Analysis and performance of Sales Team 125 in the year 2020.
- There are 4 stores, one in each state, with one salesperson responsible for each store.
- I created 2 DAX measures: "Average Products per Year" and "Total Products Sold".
- The "Salesperson" column originally contained both the name and the salesperson’s code together. Using M language, I split these values into 2 separate columns.
- The dataset for this project was extracted from Kaggle: link.
